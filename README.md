A QT based file locker(encode-decode) named skLocker (full: SadaKhata Locker)


How to Use This app?
====================

Okay, Firstly download the file named from app/ directory and change the permission to execute this file as a programme. And double click on that file. 
The username is: hasib
password is: google

Unfortunately at now you can't change the password. Sorry for that :( :(

And one more unfortunate matter, you can't use this app directly in windows. You have to build from source code which is located at codes/ directory.
